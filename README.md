# Amazon Comments Sentiment Analysis

This Python project performs sentiment analysis on Amazon comments using preprocessing techniques and three machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Hyperparameter Optimization.

## Overview

Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, or service is positive, negative, or neutral. In this project, we focus on analyzing sentiments expressed in Amazon comments using machine learning algorithms.

## Features

- Preprocessing Techniques: Data preprocessing is a crucial step in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. We employ various preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming to clean and prepare the text data for analysis.
- Logistic Regression: Logistic Regression is a popular algorithm used for binary classification tasks. We train a Logistic Regression model to classify Amazon comments into positive or negative sentiments.
- Random Forest: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes as the prediction. We utilize Random Forest for sentiment analysis to compare its performance with Logistic Regression.
- Hyperparameter Optimization: Hyperparameters are parameters that are not directly learnt within estimators. In this project, we perform hyperparameter optimization to fine-tune the parameters of our models, aiming for improved performance.
